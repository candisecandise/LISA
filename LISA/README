This system includes three main subsystems:
1. ryu patch: which inside in the ryu controller, transfer from the language to IR
2. IR: decouple, element the conflicts, compress the numbers of rules, which is language- and rule-independent
3. ovs patch: transfer from the IR to the low level rules

If there's no specific intent from the user, then we must choose a policy to control the switches.
