This version has been verified in 26 switches
and the graph in sample_topo explains the path:
the switches in orange circle are critical nodes
the black path is a original path
the red path is a original path
the brown is the result path

if you want to use this system, we recommand you:
ryuï¼šoptional(at least 4.4.2 is ok)
mininet: 2.2.0
openvswitch: 2.4.0

This system includes three main subsystems:
1. ryu patch: which inside in the ryu controller, transfer from the language to IR
2. IR: decouple, element the conflicts, compress the numbers of rules, which is language- and rule-independent
3. ovs patch: transfer from the IR to the low level rules

If there's no specific intent from the user, then we must choose a policy to control the switches.
